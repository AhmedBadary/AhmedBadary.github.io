## Q.2)


1. **$$\| x \|_\infty \leq $$ \| x \|_2$$:**  
    $$
    

**Proof.**  
Suppose $$M$$ is a $$(p\times p)$$ positive-semidefinite matrix.  
From the finite-dimensional case of the spectral theorem, it follows that $$M$$ has a nonnegative symmetric square root, that can be denoted by $$M^{\dfrac{1}{2}}$$.  
Let $${\displaystyle \mathbf {X} }$$ be any $$(p\times 1)$$ column vector-valued random variable whose covariance matrix is the $$(p\times p)$$ identity matrix.   

Then,   

$${\displaystyle \operatorname {var} (\mathbf {M} ^{1/2}\mathbf {X} )=\mathbf {M} ^{1/2}(\operatorname {var} (\mathbf {X} ))\mathbf {M} ^{1/2}=\mathbf {M} \,}$$
