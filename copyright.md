Some of the material - screenshots of diagrams or specific defintions - used in my notes and articles may have been re-purposed from other academic sources.  Most of the notes are heavily cited and sources are linked everywhere for further reference; however, if you see any material that belongs to you that you would like to get specific credit for or would like removed please contact me and I will attend to it promptly.  

Credits for the material include:
* Stanford University Courses
* UC Berkeley University Courses
* Caltech University Courses
* DeepLearning Book _(Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville)_  
* Optimization Models Book _(El Ghaoui, Calafiore)_  
* Select blog posts from major contributers in the field
