## Aitken’s $$ \Delta^2 $$ Method 
{: #content1}

1. **What?:**{: style="color: SteelBlue  "}{: .bodyContents1 #bodyContents11} \\
![definition](/main_files/128a/2.4/1.png)

2. **Why?:**{: style="color: SteelBlue  "}{: .bodyContents1 #bodyContents12} \\
    Can be used to accelerate the convergence of a sequence that is linearly convergent, regardless of its origin or application.

3. **An arbitrary technique that generates a convergent sequences does so only linearly:**{: style="color: SteelBlue  "}{: .bodyContents1 #bodyContents13} \\

    > Theorem 2.8 implies that higher-order convergence for fixed-point methods of the form
    > $$ g(p) = p $$ can occur only when $$ g(p) = 0 $$.

## Steffensen’s Method
{: #content2}

1. **What?:**{: style="color: SteelBlue  "}{: .bodyContents2 #bodyContents21} \\
    * By applying a modification of Aitken’s $$ \Delta^2 $$ method to a linearly convergent sequence obtained
    from fixed-point iteration, we can accelerate the convergence to quadratic.

2. **Zeros and their Multiplicity:**{: style="color: SteelBlue  "}{: .bodyContents2 #bodyContents22} \\

3. **Difference from Aitken's method:**{: style="color: SteelBlue  "}{: .bodyContents2 #bodyContents23} \\
    * **Aitken's method:** Constructs the terms in order
    ![Thm](/main_files/128a/2.4/8.png)
    * **Steffensen’s method:** constructs the same
    first four terms, $$p_0, p_1, p_2,$$ and $$\widetilde{p}_0$$. However, at this step we assume that $$\widetilde{p}_0$$ is a better
    approximation to $$p$$ than is $$p_2$$ and apply fixed-point iteration to $$\widetilde{p}_0$$ instead of $$p2$$
    ![Thm](/main_files/128a/2.4/9.png)

    > Notice \\
    > Every third term of the Steffensen sequence is generated by Eq. (2.15);\\
    > the others use fixed-point iteration on the previous term.

4. **The method:**{: style="color: SteelBlue  "}{: .bodyContents2 #bodyContents24} \\
    > Example:
    > Let $$f (x) = e^x − x − 1$$ 
    > Notice that Newton’s method with $$p_0 = 1$$ converges to the zero $$x=0$$ but not quadratically

    > Note that $$\Delta^2 p_n$$ might be 0, which would introduce a 0 in the denominator of the next
    > iterate. If this occurs, we terminate the sequence and select $$p_2^{(n−1)}$$
    > as the best approximation.

5. **Steffensen’s method gives quadratic convergence without evaluating a derivative:**{: style="color: SteelBlue  "}{: .bodyContents2 #bodyContents25} \\

    ![definition](/main_files/128a/2.4/11.png){:width="70%"}

    * **Properties:**
        * If g has the required continuity conditions, functional iteration applied to $$g$$ will be
        quadratically convergent regardless of the multiplicity of the zero of $$f$$ .
        * Theoretically, the only drawback to this method is the additional calculation of $$f
        (x)$$ and the more laborious procedure of calculating the iterates.
        * In practice, multiple roots can cause serious round-off problems because the denominator of (2.13) consists of the difference of twonumbers that are both close to 0.
        * In the case of a simple zero the original Newton’s method requires substantially less computation.
