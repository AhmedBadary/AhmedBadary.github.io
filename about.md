# Hello, my name is AB!
<p class="message">
  Hey there! A brief rundown of my trajectory.
</p>
I attended UC Berkeley from Fall 2014 to Fall 2017 pursuing three degrees in Theoretical Physics, Applied Mathematics (Statstical Learning Focus), and Computer Science.

I was able to finish my schoolwork and pursue higher education earlier than usual. I then pursued Theoretical Physics and Pure Mathematics.

I am really interested in theory. Focusing primarily on theoretical physics beyond the standard model, perturbation theory and PDE's.

My focus, however, has shifted significantly. Currently, I would consider my main research focus to be "Statistical Learning Theory". Primairly on the intersection between Mathematics and statistical learning regimes like Machine Learning and Deep Learning.  With a lot of experience in applying Statistical Modeling and Deep Learning in NLP.

Here you'll find my notes on some diverse topics related to those fields, and a brief showcase of my projects.
